Just as information cannot escape a black hole once it has entered, attention rarely escapes the scroll of a social media feed engineered to keep you in for as long as possible.

Recently, whilst at my co-working space, I found myself overhearing the complaints of a team of people working in marketing at a major label. Their artist had invested a five-figure sum into a social media campaign, and was upset with the poor ROI they were seeing in terms of engagement. I overheard the name of the artist and out of curiosity looked them up. What I saw was an artist who clearly wasn’t geared for social media marketing - the wrong music, the wrong image - a personal brand and style at odds with a marketing channel that requires immediately engaging, easily digestible content produced on a regular basis.

What stood out to me was that the marketing team didn’t take a step back and consider whether social media was the correct approach for this artist, but instead held the view that they should double down and focus on investing even more time and effort into creating content. It was clear that they didn’t for a second entertain the idea that their strategy of focusing on social media was wrong, but of course the reason for the poor performance had to be the artist not doing a good enough job with their content.

I saw a similar situation when working at a record label. One act was spending many thousands of pounds a month with an agency to produce content for TikTok, but were not seeing traction on the platform to justify the expense. Thankfully, they eventually realised they were burning a lot of money with this arrangement for little upside and took the TikTok content job in house. Again, there was no moment where they took a step back and assessed whether TikTok was a platform worth investing all this time and money into, despite the act’s target demographics and social content style not particularly suited for the platform audience. Their conclusion was that because the TikTok agency wasn’t producing the results they were after, it was the deal with the agency that needed reassessment, not the marketing strategy.

This pattern of strategic myopia – the blinkered view that social media is the default, be-all and end-all marketing channel – has created an industry that throws time, effort and money into a black hole, hoping that they might see a return on the basis that because everyone else is doing it, it must be correct.

Social media platforms are designed to keep the user on their feed for as long as possible. The longer you stay scrolling, the more adverts the platform can serve you. When assessed this bluntly, one thing becomes clear: your interests as a marketer are at odds with the interests of the platform. If I want to convert a social media view to something that will generate me revenue, I need to direct the viewer off-platform – whether that be to a DSP, a ticket site, a merch store or something else. I now find myself in a position where I am having to fight against the design of the platform, one which has been refined and optimised by huge teams to keep eyes and attention from wandering elsewhere. How does information escape a black hole? It doesn’t. How does attention escape a social media platform?

The idea that social media acts as a funnel, capturing low value attention and directing it towards high value engagement, is one that to me reflects a misunderstanding of the core functions and interests of the platform. Now I am not arguing that social media has no utility, but I believe social media is best used when you flip the funnel on its head.

Social media should be the final destination of the fan journey, not the starting point. Don't build a funnel that tries to capture and deepen fleeting attention. Build depth first via other channels and methods of engagement, then use social media to broadcast to those who are familiar with and invested in what you have to say.

This reversal is important, because it determines which of the two types of music discovery you create:


1. Active, mindful, high-quality discovery: The result of an engaged audience, one which is there with intent and attention.


2. Passive, mindless, low-quality discovery: The result of an audience which just so happens to be there when you shout from the megaphone. An audience which - whilst not necessarily disinterested in what you want them to hear – is nevertheless just passing through on their way to somewhere else.

Now, if social media really is the digital town square, then in this square I could shout to everyone passing through, or I could find where interested listeners gather first. Once I've built those relationships, my megaphone becomes more effective - people who already know me are now primed to listen when they encounter me again in the square.

By treating social media as the final destination on the journey, we stop fighting against the platform for attention and engagement and start to consider how we might better generate discovery through other avenues. This loosens the view of social media as the default, primary marketing method of the modern industry, encouraging us to find better ways to reach and engage new fans.

In part 2 I will be discussing how recent geopolitical fractures and grey-zone tactics could see the social media black hole collapse in on itself completely, and what this would mean for an industry reliant on such marketing channels.
