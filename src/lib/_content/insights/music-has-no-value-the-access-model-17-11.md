The title of this article is something not many in the music industry would argue with a straight face; after all, the music industry is fundamentally built around exploiting music to extract the maximum possible value. But I’d hope that by the end of this article you’d at least understand why I say this, if not agree with my take outright.

So why do I say that music has no value? First of all, I should clarify what I mean by value in the first place. There are two types of value when it comes to music:

- **Subjective, or ‘soft’, value** - emotional meaning that we attach to music, both personally and culturally.
- **Objective, or ‘hard’, value** - economic worth measured in pounds, dollars, euros, etc.

Of course, arguing that music has no subjective, emotional value would be nonsensical, as the very nature of subjectivity means that it is dependent on the personal experience of the perceiver. What I am arguing here is that there is no inherent objective economic value in a piece of music, and the music industry has never been about generating income by selling music.

To lay the groundwork for the point I have set out to make, we should first take a look through a very brief overview of the history of the monetisation of music:

It is generally thought that the earliest form of income generation related to music would have been that of patronage. In the ancient civilisations of Egypt and Greece, musicians would be supported by wealthy sponsors, both private and state, who would provide the means for the artist to sustain themselves whilst writing and performing music.

During the Middle Ages, wandering minstrels could be found across Europe, and similar equivalents throughout the known world. These musicians would often travel from town to town, performing for both public and private crowds, generating an income from performance fees and public donations.

The advent of the printing press in the mid-15th century revolutionised the way written information could be distributed. With this revolution came the emergence of sheet music as a form of music monetisation. For the first time, music itself could now be sold at an accessible price, and reproduced by anybody who had the means to do so.

Thomas Edison’s phonograph, invented in 1877, ushered in the modern concept of recorded music: a direct capture and reproduction of a unique music performance. Over the years, countless physical recorded music formats have come and gone: cylinder records, vinyl, reel-to-reel, cassette, CDs, 8-tracks, MiniDiscs, to name but a few. For over a century, these physical formats defined how people consumed music. But with the rise of personal computers and the internet in the late 20th century, music could now be purchased and distributed digitally, anywhere in the world and at any time. Music increasingly began to leave the physical world, returning back to the immaterial world it inhabited for the vast majority of its existence.

That brings us to today, where streaming platforms such as Spotify and Apple Music dominate the current music landscape. The piracy boom at the turn of the millennium ravaged income from recorded music, as bit-perfect copies could be effortlessly and quickly shared worldwide. These music streaming platforms came to be partially as a response to the death of recorded music sales, necessitating an unheard-of value proposition: almost the entirety of the world’s recorded music, available monthly for the price of a single album. This value proposition has only grown stronger as time goes on, with the current price of Spotify representing a real-terms price decrease of 26.8% compared to 2008 when adjusted for inflation.

From this brief overview of music monetisation, one thing becomes very apparent: recorded music, though currently held to be the core form of economic value in music, is in reality one which has come to exist in only the past century and a half. I argue that we have become used to recorded music being the primary form of music monetisation, and have in turn mistaken it for the form from which all value in music is ultimately derived. In reality, recorded music has only ever been one expression of where the actual economic value of music is, and always has been: access. Through patrons enabling the profession and performance of dedicated musicians in ancient civilisations, wandering minstrels gigging across towns and cities in the Middle Ages, sheet music bringing music to the home, physical and digital formats enabling the performance of the artist to be heard on demand, and streaming putting the entirety of recorded music in the palm of your hand; the thread that connects them all is access.

For as long as it has existed, the music industry has always been in the profession of monetising access. Access to live music, access to the means to reproduce music on demand, access to a deeper connection to the artist. I call this lens through which to view the music industry _the Access Model_.

What can we take from this shift in how we see value in music? For one, the industry is not in a death spiral caused by the economic devaluation of recorded music. People were earning a living from music long before records existed, and the emotional value of music, the ultimate expression of value, has never changed. The music industry is simply moving towards a different way of operating, perhaps one a lot closer to how it had functioned for thousands of years. Whilst we live in a period of great change in music monetisation, the core value proposition remains the same as ever: access.

In **Part 2**, I look at the practical implications of the Access Model: how new technologies expand what access can mean, why streaming has become economically peripheral, and how music is monetised through culture, experience, and connection rather than recordings themselves.
