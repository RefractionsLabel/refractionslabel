description: A comprehensive sample article to test all the features of your new Markdown-to-HTML pipeline.
---

This is a sample article designed to test if your Markdown is rendering correctly. If you're seeing this, the first paragraph is already working!

Let's dive into the various elements you can use.

## Text Formatting

Here we test the basic text styles. You should see a variety of formatting below:

-   This is **bold text**.
-   This is _italic text_.
-   This is also __bold text__ and __italic text__.
-   This is a combination of ***bold and italic***.
-   Sometimes you want to ~~strike through~~ text.

## Lists

Lists are a cornerstone of web content. Let's check both ordered and unordered lists, including nested ones.

### Unordered List

*   Item 1: A simple list item.
*   Item 2: With a sub-list.
    *   Sub-item A: This should be indented.
    *   Sub-item B: So should this.
*   Item 3: Back to the main level.

### Ordered List

1.  First, we start with number one.
2.  Then, we move on to number two.
3.  And finally, number three.
    1.  We can also nest ordered lists.
    2.  This is the second nested item.
4.  The list continues from here.

### Task List (Checklist)

-   [x] Complete the Markdown parser setup.
-   [ ] Add the Tailwind Typography plugin.
-   [ ] Write a new article using these features.

## Links and Images

Images are also crucial. Below is a placeholder image that should render correctly.

## Blockquotes

Sometimes you need to quote someone.

> "The ability to render Markdown is a fundamental feature for any modern CMS-driven website. It empowers content creators and separates content from presentation."
>
> > And you can even nest blockquotes for replies or sub-points.

## Code Blocks

Displaying code is a common requirement. We can have `inline code` like `{@html content}` right in the middle of a sentence.

Or, we can have larger, fenced code blocks with syntax highlighting (this will work automatically with many themes or plugins like the typography plugin).
