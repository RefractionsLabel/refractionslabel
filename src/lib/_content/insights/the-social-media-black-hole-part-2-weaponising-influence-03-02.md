In Part 1 of this series, we discussed attention trapped beyond the event horizon of the social media black hole. In Part 2, we will take a creative break from the laws of physics, and discuss the possibility of this social media black hole collapsing in on itself completely.

In recent months and years, there have been a few moments where the operations of a social media platform have seemed to be hanging by a thread. In early 2025, the United States implemented a nationwide ban of TikTok. Whilst the severing of this thread in the case of the US lasted only three days, TikTok is currently banned in a handful of countries worldwide, the most notable of which is India.

In early 2026, X (formerly Twitter) found itself in a similar situation. With its integrated AI chatbot Grok having been discovered to be perfectly happy generating vast amounts of illicit content, X now found itself facing bans from a host of countries, and indeed receiving such from Indonesia and Malaysia. Whilst X eventually reined in the ‘creative capabilities’ of Grok, and unwound the bans it had received, the real danger of the social media platform had been let slip in the process. Whilst the United Kingdom assessed how to respond to X’s indiscretions, members of the US Congress were busy drafting legislation to “sanction not only Starmer, but Britain as a whole” if the UK moved to ban the platform. Now, why would the US sanction “Britain as a whole” over it banning X? Seems a bit dramatic, no?

The answer to this question lies in a document published by the United States a few months prior. The 2025 National Security Strategy, a periodical document which lists national security concerns and the US’ plans to tackle them, marked a radical shift in America’s view of the world; who’s good, who’s bad, and where the US stands in it all. Perhaps the most striking takeaway from this document was the change in attitude towards Europe - a scathing assessment of the continent which diagnosed “economic decline” and “civilisational erasure” as chronic symptoms. Among policies listed to “help Europe correct its current trajectory”, the US laid bare their strategy of “cultivating resistance to Europe’s current trajectory within European nations”. Whilst somewhat open to interpretation, cultivating resistance within a sovereign nation can broadly be taken to mean engaging in acts of foreign political interference. And what is the best ‘soft’ (i.e. non-militaristic) weapon one can yield to interfere in the domestic politics of a nation? That would be information.

Information can be weaponised to influence public perception, to widen existing cracks in a society, to bend the will of the people towards him who wields it. The double-edged sword of the information age we live in today means that, whilst the truth is more easily accessible than ever, so is true of information that seeks to distort, mislead and destabilise. And what is the vector which is most capable of disseminating information of all flavours and varieties? That would be social media. And here lies the answer to our earlier question of why the US would sanction “Britain as a whole” over the banning of X. Ban X, and you ban one of the best methods of “cultivating resistance to Europe’s current trajectory within European nations”.

What does this tell us about X, and social media platforms more generally? These platforms are increasingly becoming pawns in a great geopolitical game — tools which can be used to control not just the flow of information, but to control the information itself. This is something that is already prevalent on these platforms.

The modern world has become ever more increasingly reliant on these social media platforms, and the music industry has gleefully followed suit. As discussed in part 1, social media has now become the default, be-all and end-all marketing channel for the music industry. Brands now build their entire marketing strategies and focus their entire followings around a handful of social media platforms. But what happens when a geopolitical pawn is captured by an opposing player? Social media is quickly showing its volatility, its fragility and its capacity for weaponisation in a far greater game than the one the music industry plays.

This leaves me with one question. Do you want to leave your marketing strategy exposed to the geopolitical whims of adversarial nations? By going all in on social media, you go all in on a channel which demonstrates an inherent capacity for instability. If one country decides to restrict the social media access of another, how does a brand communicate? If a nation bans a social media platform in the interest of national security, they are also banning the marketing strategy for all those who have built a reliance on it. This instability is where the social media black hole faces a real risk of imploding.

Fittingly, I believe the best way to assuage such risk is to take another look at the current geopolitical landscape. When overreliance rears its ugly head, the smart move is to diversify. If the response to a changing world order is to forge new alliances, perhaps similar lessons can be applied to marketing too.
