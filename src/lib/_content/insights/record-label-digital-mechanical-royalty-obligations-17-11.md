Getting your head around the complex nature of music royalties can be one of the most confusing aspects of launching a record label, but it is also one of the most important. Understanding who is owed what, when and why is essential for fulfilling the most basic purpose of a record label: making money from music and paying that money to the rightsholder.

With all this said, my efforts to understand the responsibility Refractions had towards mechanical royalties came up frustratingly short. It seemed that nobody really knew the answer to the question, and resources either glossed over the subject or consistently contradicted one another. Physical media made sense – for each copy you create, you pay a mechanical royalty. But what about digital? Does a label need to pay every time a track is purchased on Beatport? What about music streaming?

Through this process of trying to understand the mechanical obligations of Refractions, I reached out to people across the recorded music industry:

* Collection Societies
* Royalty Platforms
* Distributors
* Download Stores
* Label Managers

What follows is the result of my research into the current state of digital mechanical royalty obligations for record labels.

**DSPs - World excl. US**

In all territories other than the US, digital service providers (DSPs) directly handle mechanical royalties for both streaming and downloads. The DSP will have a direct relationship with a local mechanical rights organisation (MRO) and will pay mechanicals out automatically to the relevant organisation. When music is streamed or downloaded through DSPs, the label has no mechanical royalty responsibility, even if the writer is unpublished or unaffiliated with an MRO.

**DSPs - US**

For streaming, DSPs automatically handle the payment of mechanical royalties via an agreement with the Mechanical Licensing Collective (MLC). There is no responsibility on the label to obtain or manage a mechanical licence for streaming income in the US.

For download sales, however, the label is required to secure a mechanical licence for the reproduction of the musical composition. This can be done in one of two ways:

1. Obtain a licence via the Harry Fox Agency (HFA) – you can pre-purchase a licence for a set number of digital download sales. This requires estimating your expected sales and comes with upfront costs and administrative overhead.


2. Direct licensing – you can negotiate directly with the rightsholder to obtain the necessary mechanical licence. This can be managed in the contract between the label and the rightsholder, where a controlled composition clause may be included. Controlled composition clauses are legally valid in the digital realm and commonly used to simplify the licensing of downloads, especially when the artist is also the writer.

**D2C - World**

Direct-to-Consumer (D2C) download platforms such as Bandcamp operate differently to DSPs in that they do not automatically handle mechanical royalties. Instead, mechanical royalties for D2C downloads are typically the responsibility of the label. As such, you should work under the assumption that for any D2C platform, the label will need to secure mechanical licences through either HFA or direct negotiation.

Bandcamp now offers an optional mechanical royalty payment feature, but it is currently limited in scope. In response to an enquiry made in April 2025, Bandcamp stated:

> *We are working to expand our coverage of PRO/MRO/Collection Societies, but at this time, we accrue royalties for sales made in Canada, the UK, the EU, New Zealand, and Australia. For all other territories, you'll be responsible for paying those royalties for now.*

Given the partial coverage and limited functionality, it is advisable to handle mechanicals for Bandcamp and other D2C platforms independently to ensure compliance and complete coverage.

**Label Approach in Practice**

I discussed this topic with the founder of a royalty accounting platform, and the conclusion I came to was that the most time- and cost-effective way to handle US download DSP and D2C mechanicals is:

* Include mechanical licensing terms directly in the artist contract (e.g., via a controlled composition clause),

* Handle royalty payments through a platform that offers complete royalty management, rather than using HFA.

This avoids the need to estimate digital download sales in advance and gives the label more flexibility and control over how mechanical royalties are managed.

**Territorial Summary**

* Streaming DSPs (World): Mechanical royalties handled by DSPs/MROs.
* Download DSPs (World excl. US): Handled by DSPs/MROs, no label responsibility.
* Download DSPs (US): Label must license and pay mechanicals.
* D2C (World): Label should assume responsibility unless clear to the contrary.
